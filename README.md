# Cooked Nuggets

Cooked Nuggets is an attempt to clone [over.gg](https://www.over.gg/), a website I frequently visit to gain information about the Overwatch competitive scene.  I wanted to see if I could replicate some of the features of the website as well as practice more Rails and React.

Here is a link to the website --> https://cookednuggets.herokuapp.com/

## Built With

* Rails 5.2
* React
* Blizzard OWL API

## Getting Started

1. Clone Repository  ```git clone https://github.com/Aakup/MultiMeet```
3. Enter directory and Install packages ```bundle install --without production```
4. Create and seed database ```db:setup```
5. Start app on http://localhost:3000 ```rails s```

## TODO

* Add Transfers page
* Add Stats
